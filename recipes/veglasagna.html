    <p>This amazing recipe is a vegetarian lasagna that's easy to make and has spinach in it for all of the spinach lovers out there. Personally, I think spinach is okay, but I'm vegetarian so I'm forced to eat this stuff.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh spinach</li>
        <li>8 ounce container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried basil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup pasta sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Drain spinach.</li>
        <li>Mix spinach, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, egg, nutmeg, basil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/4 cup pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta mixture, and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. End with remaining 3 lasagna noodles and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese on top. Cover casserole with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover casserole and continue baking until lasagna is bubbling and lightly browned, about 25 more minutes. Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
